# TypeScript

## Why TypeScript?
- **Improving scalability of Javascript:** Typescript provides features such as classes, interfaces, and modules that help to organize and structure code in a more maintainable way
- **Improving code readability and maintainability:** Javascript is a dynamic language which it makes hard to maintian over time. Typescript adds type annotations and other features that improve readability and maintainability.
- **Includes type safety feature** to Javascript allowing developers to catch errors before runtime.
- **Reduce bugs/runtime errors** while developing
