# About

The blog posts here are all about my learning journey of Web Development, from frontend to backend. The intention of creating this blog is that I wanted to record and reflect on what I've learnt from the bootcamp, projects, documentations and tutorials. The blog posts will be created as `issues` because it's easier for organizing and commenting blog posts.
